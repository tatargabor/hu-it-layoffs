## Context

The report dashboard at `tatargabor.github.io/hu-it-layoffs/report.html` is a static HTML page generated by `src/visualize.py`. It currently has no visitor analytics. GoatCounter account is already set up at `hu-it-layoffs.goatcounter.com`.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Track page views on the report dashboard via GoatCounter
- Zero impact on existing functionality

**Non-Goals:**
- Custom event tracking (clicks, scroll depth, etc.)
- Embedding visitor stats into the report itself
- GitHub traffic API data collection (separate concern)

## Decisions

**GoatCounter script placement**: Insert before `</body>` in the HTML template string within `generate_html()` in `src/visualize.py`.
- Rationale: Standard placement, async loading, no render blocking.
- Alternative: `<head>` placement — rejected, `</body>` is best practice for analytics scripts.

**Hardcoded endpoint**: The GoatCounter URL (`hu-it-layoffs.goatcounter.com`) is hardcoded in the template, not configurable via env var.
- Rationale: This is a single-use project, not a library. No need for configurability.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [Ad blockers may block GoatCounter] → Acceptable, no mitigation needed. GoatCounter is blocked less often than GA.
- [CDN `gc.zgo.at` down] → Page loads fine, script is `async`. Only analytics stops.
